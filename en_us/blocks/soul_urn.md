# Soul Urn

![Soul Urn](block:betterwithmods:urn@8)

For ingame guide:
The soul urn is a block created using the filtered hopper. its purpose is to make soul forged steel. as its a ingredient used to make it, to make it, place a regular urn right under a filtered hopper (many people may confuse the bottom of the filtered hopper as the place where it connects to a axle. it can be any side!) and place in a soul sand. once you have done that take 8 ground netherrack. once all 8 have been converted it will force the souls in the soul sand to move down into the urn. creating a soul urn!. repeat to make more!
